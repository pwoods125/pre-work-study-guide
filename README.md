# Paris's Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Coding and web development can seem very intimidating to think about because there are so many aspects to consider. The purpose of this prework study guide was to create a study resource for bootcamp students and other individuals with an interest in coding by covering topics such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. With this guide, I have found that when learning something new, it is best to focus on what’s important first. The minor things will come with practice.
