        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
     <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
     <li> Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
<li> The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport </li>
<li> The charset (character set) element sets our character encoding.</li>
<li> The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
<li> The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>

<li> The parent element is the element that holds all the child elements together.</li> 
<li> The body element is known as a parent element.</li>
<li> The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element, where the name of the element describes its content and the role on a webpage.</li>
<li> Semantic HTML elements make HTML easier to read by other developers and browsers, and create accessibility to more users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
<li> Non-semantic elements exist, such as div, which creates a division in the page, and span that creates an inline division.</li>
<li> The h1 to h6 elements are headings, which are larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to help organize a page.</li>
<li> The h1 element is the biggest heading and should only appear once on each page.</li>
<li> The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
<li> The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items through the use of bullets or numbers.</li>
<li> All HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about elements.</li>
<li> HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
<li> The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
<li> The img element can contain various attributes such as the src attribute, which defines the location or source of an image.</li>
<li> The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
<li> The a element is the anchor that creates links to the same or other webpages.</li>
<li> The href attribute within the a element points to a specific URL for a link.</li>
<li> The section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
<li> HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
