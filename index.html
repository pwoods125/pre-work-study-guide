        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
     <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
     <li> Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
<li> The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport </li>
<li> The charset (character set) element sets our character encoding.</li>
<li> The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
<li> The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
<li> The title element defines the title for a webpage and is required for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
<li> The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
<li> The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
<li> The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
<li> The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
<li> Within HTML, “parent/child” language is often used to explain the relationship among elements.</li>
<li> Child elements are elements that are nested inside other elements.</li> 
<li> The parent element is the element that holds all the child elements together.</li> 
<li> The body element is known as a parent element.</li>
<li> The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element, where the name of the element describes its content and the role on a webpage.</li>
<li> Semantic HTML elements make HTML easier to read by other developers and browsers, and create accessibility to more users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
<li> Non-semantic elements exist, such as div, which creates a division in the page, and span that creates an inline division.</li>
<li> The h1 to h6 elements are headings, which are larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to help organize a page.</li>
<li> The h1 element is the biggest heading and should only appear once on each page.</li>
<li> The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
<li> The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items through the use of bullets or numbers.</li>
<li> All HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about elements.</li>
<li> HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
<li> The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
<li> The img element can contain various attributes such as the src attribute, which defines the location or source of an image.</li>
<li> The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
<li> The a element is the anchor that creates links to the same or other webpages.</li>
<li> The href attribute within the a element points to a specific URL for a link.</li>
<li> The section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
<li> HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
<li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property such as color: blue, which indicates the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
<li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS, which includes inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
<li>Inline CSS is When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
<li>Each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
<li>Internal CSS style sheet embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element.</li>
<li>External CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file.</li>
<li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
<li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code, which can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
<li>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.</li>
<li>A link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
<li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
<li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
<li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
<li>A period preceding card designates this as a class selector, which allows any HTML element assigned to the class to gain the property assignments from the CSS.</li>
<li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame.</li>
<li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue, or by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>
