        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
     <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
     <li> Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
<li> The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport </li>
<li> The charset (character set) element sets our character encoding.</li>
<li> The http-equiv element sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
<li> The viewport element sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
<li> The title element defines the title for a webpage and is required for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
<li> The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
<li> The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
<li> The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
<li> The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
<li> Within HTML, “parent/child” language is often used to explain the relationship among elements.</li>
<li> Child elements are elements that are nested inside other elements.</li> 
<li> The parent element is the element that holds all the child elements together.</li> 
<li> The body element is known as a parent element.</li>
<li> The body element is an example of a semantic HTML element, where the name of the element describes its content and the role on a webpage.</li>
<li> Semantic HTML elements make HTML easier to read by other developers and browsers, and create accessibility to more users, including those who use assistive technologies such as screen readers.</li>
<li> Non-semantic elements exist, such as div, which creates a division in the page, and span that creates an inline division.</li>
<li> The h1 to h6 elements are headings, which are larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to help organize a page.</li>
<li> The h1 element is the biggest heading and should only appear once on each page.</li>
<li> The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
<li> The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items through the use of bullets or numbers.</li>
<li> All HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about elements.</li>
<li> HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
<li> The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
<li> The img element can contain various attributes such as the src attribute, which defines the location or source of an image.</li>
<li> The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
<li> The a element is the anchor that creates links to the same or other webpages.</li>
<li> The href attribute within the a element points to a specific URL for a link.</li>
<li> The section elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
<li> HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
<li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property such as color: blue, which indicates the CSS property color and the value for that property, blue.</li>
<li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS, which includes inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
<li>Inline CSS is When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
<li>Each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
<li>Internal CSS style sheet embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element.</li>
<li>External CSS style sheet allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file.</li>
<li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
<li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code, which can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
<li>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.</li>
<li>A link element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
<li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
<li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
<li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
<li>A period preceding card designates this as a class selector, which allows any HTML element assigned to the class to gain the property assignments from the CSS.</li>
<li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame.</li>
<li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue, or by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
    <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
    <li>git checkout branch-name takes switches to that branch.</li>
<li>The git command must precede every Git statement.</li>
<li>git add -A : adds all modifications in the current working branch to the staging area, which informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit.</li>
<li>git commit -m “DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES” :Commits the changes from git add -A, with specific description of what was fixed or changed.</li>
<li>git pull origin main : ensures the main branch is up to date and you are working with the correct patch.</li>
<li>git push origin branch-name : push the branch-name local changes to the remote GitHub branch.</li>
<li>Always push to the current working feature branch to avoid any possible bugs going into the main branch on accident.</li>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
<li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom, and the order of the code matters.</li>
<li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
<li>Assignment operator is used to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
<li>A string is contained within quotation marks and refer to the variable's name.</li>
<li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
<li>The console.log method can be use to output a message to the web console by adding an argument inside the parentheses.</li>
<li>The word console within the console.log method refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code.</li>
<li>The second part of the console.log method, .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer and will output whatever is added inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
<li>The script.js file is linked within the body element of the HTML.</li>
<li>To see console.log in action, we need to use Chrome DevTools.</li>
<li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code.</li>
<li>Using conditional statements such as if statements allow us to interrupt control flow.</li>
<li>An if statement is an example of a conditional statement and provides one or more conditions for the computer to evaluate.</li>
<li>When using the if statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition or is true.</li>
<li>If the condition is Falsy, or not truthy, the code will not execute, interrupting the control flow.</li>
<li>If one condition is truthy, the computer will execute the code that we provide between curly brackets.</li>
<li>We use else if when we want to provide more conditions than just if.</li>
<li>The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal.</li>
<li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
<li>An index is a unique number locates the data item in the array.</li>
<li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential, meaning that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.</li>
<li>The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
<li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
<li>We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named length.</li>
<li>A for loop contains the starting point for the loop, the condition, and a statement to allows the array to iterate over each item.</li>
<li>The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1, so every time a code loops, x will increase by 1.</li>
<li>A for loop starts with for.</li>
<li>A commenting out code is used to make a block of code inactive without deleting it.</li>
<li>Functions are reusable blocks of code that contain instructions to perform a specific task.</li>
<li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses.</li>
